# Motivation
For this project I wanted to create a simple web application that visualises some structured data. On the front-end, I wanted to learn JavaScript with the React framework and D3.js library. On the back-end, I wanted to learn REST API design in Python using Flask, as well as simple data requesting and manipulation processes. Lastly, I wanted to become acquainted with the process of deploying services to AWS.

# How To Use
