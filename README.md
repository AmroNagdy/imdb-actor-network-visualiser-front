# Motivation
For this project I wanted to create a simple web application that visualises some structured data. On the front-end, I wanted to learn JavaScript with the React framework and D3.js library. On the back-end, I wanted to learn REST API design in Python using Flask, as well as simple data requesting and manipulation processes. 

# How To Use
TBD
